# Nigeria-House-Price-Predictive-Model
I trained a Random Forest Regressor model to predict house prices in Nigeria, focusing on properties like Detached Duplex, Terraced Duplex, Semi-Detached Duplex, and Detached Bungalow.
The Random Forest model achieved a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 38.1 million Naira, improving significantly over the baseline model, which had an MAE of 50.23 million Naira. I also trained a Linear Regression model and a Decision Tree Regressor model, but the Random Forest Regressor outperformed both in terms of MAE.
